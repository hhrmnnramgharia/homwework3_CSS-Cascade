# To-Do List Web App

## Overview
This project is a simple yet functional To-Do List web app designed to help users manage and track their tasks effectively. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and visually differentiate between active and completed tasks. Tasks that are completed will be visually updated with a checkmark, strikethrough, or color change.

## Key Features
Background Image: A relevant background image sets the mood for the "To-Do List" theme.
Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts for different screen sizes to ensure an optimal viewing experience.
Task Management: Users can mark tasks as "in progress" or "completed," with tasks being visually updated accordingly.
Interactive Feedback: Upon marking a task as completed, the text will change color, strike-through will be applied, and a graphic such as a checkmark or thumbs-up will appear.
